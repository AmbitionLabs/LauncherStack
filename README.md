# LauncherStack
Collection of simple web app launchers 

## Overview

Lancherstack is a collection of compiled launchers that pull up a popular sites as a app using edge's --app flag.  

Any application with a web interface can be replaced up using this method and any site can be 'appified' as long as you have Edge browser installed.

## Useful for:
- appifying favorite web services/pages with a clickable iconized .exe
- preventing the need to install apps that have a web version thus freeing the user experience from cluttersome apps
- replacing or working around broken or misbehaving windows installed apps by leveraging their web-app feature
- building a clean and custom windows user interface (especially when paired with auto window placement and launcher apps)
- giving business users an app they want.. without giving a business users an app they want 
- eliminating maintenance overhead of a local app in favor of a web version with minimal change in user experience.  (*app dependent)
