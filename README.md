# LauncherStack
Collection of simple web app launchers 

## Overview

Lancherstack is a collection of launchers that pull up popular sites as a app using edge's --app flag.  
 
Any site can be 'appified' as long as you have Edge browser installed,
 thus any application that has a web version can be replaced up using this method.
 
## Useful for:
- appifying favorite web services/pages with a clickable iconized .exe
- eliminating maintenance overhead of a local app in favor of a web version with minimal change in user experience. 
- replacing or working around broken or misbehaving windows installed apps by leveraging their web-based cousins
- building a clean and custom windows user interface (especially when paired with ui and and launcher apps)
- giving business users an app they want.. without giving a business users an app they want
