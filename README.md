- replacing or working around broken or misbehaving windows installed apps by leveraging their web-app feature
- building a clean and custom windows user interface (especially when paired with auto window placement and launcher apps)
- giving business users an app they want.. without giving a business users an app they want 
- eliminating maintenance overhead of a local app in favor of a web version with minimal change in user experience.  (*app dependent)
