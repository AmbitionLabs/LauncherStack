# LauncherStack
Collection of simple web app launchers 

## Overview

Lancherstack is a collection of compiled launchers that pull up a popular sites as a app using edge's --app flag.  

Any application that has a web version can be replaced up using this method and any site can be 'appified' as long as you have Edge browser installed.

## Useful for:
- appifying favorite web services/pages with a clickable iconized .exe
- eliminating maintenance overhead of a local app in favor of a web version with minimal change in user experience. 
- replacing or working around broken or misbehaving windows installed apps by leveraging their web-app feature
- building a clean and custom windows user interface (especially when paired with ui and and launcher apps)
- giving business users an app they want.. without giving a business users an app they want

## Acknowledgements

- The executables were compiled using MScholtes's PS2EXE compiler: https://github.com/MScholtes/PS2EXE

If there's a web site you'd like to appify that you don't see on the list, just replace the URL in one of the .ps1 files with the desired URL; compile with PS2EXE if desired.
