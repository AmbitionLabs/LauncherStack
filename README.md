# LauncherStack
Collection of simple web app launchers for edge

##Overview

Lancherstack is a collection of compiled launchers that pull up commonly a commonly used site as a app using edge's --app flag.  Any application with a web interface can be called up using this method.

##Useful for:
-preventing the need to install apps that have a web version thus freeing the user experience from cluttersome apps
-replacing or working around broken or misbehaving windows installed apps
-building a clean and custom windows user interface (expecially paired with auto window placement and lancher apps)
-giving buisiness users an app they want.. without giving them the app they want
